## Problem statement

The amount of data being generated nowadays is absolutely mind-boggling. This data can be a valuable
resource for researchers. However, privacy regulations will prevent easy access to this wealth of
data, and this is a good thing. Privacy enhancing technologies (PETs) are a way to gain valuable
insights from sensitive data while still respecting the privacy Furthermore, researchers are often more interested in the insights derived from data
rather than the raw data itself. This raises an intriguing question: Can we unlock these valuable
insights in a manner that upholds and respects privacy standards?

## Introducing the landscape of PETs

## Data partitioning

## Example: federated average

## Technology doesn't solve everything

Paperwork, trust, etc.
