<p>The amount of data being generated nowadays is absolutely
mind-boggling. This data can be a valuable resource for researchers.
However, personal data should be handled with great care and
responsibility because of its sensitive nature. This is why there are
privacy regulations in place like <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/" class="external-link">GDPR</a> to prohibit easy access to this
wealth of data.</p>
<p>However, often researchers are not interested in the personal records
that make up the data, but rather in the <em>insights</em> derived from
it. This raises an intriguing question: Can we unlock these valuable
insights in a manner that upholds and respects privacy standards?</p>
<p>In classic data analysis, all data is copied over into a single
place. This makes it very easy to use conventional data analysis
software and tools to gain insights.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>The first step in the process is often <em>data anonymization</em>.
Personal identifiable information will in this case be removed so that
individuals stay anonymous. Data <em>pseudonimization</em> is a similar
process, but in this case, the records will be assigned an id that will
make it possible to link individuals across datasets.</p>
<figure><img src="fig%2Fdata_anonymization.jpg" alt="Names are censored before the datasets are sent to a central place" class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">Data anonymization</div>
</figure><p>While data anonymization and pseudonymization are often a good first
step, there is no guarantee that the data will never be reidentified. A
famous example of reidentification is the story of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix_Prize" class="external-link">Netflix prize</a>.
The Netflix prize was an open competition to build the best recommender
system to predict user ratings for films based on previous ratings. The
data was anonymized, but in 2007 two researchers from The University of
Texas at Austin were able to identify a large number of users by
matching the dataset with film ratings on the Internet Movie Database
(IMDB).</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>There are different ways in which privacy risks can be mitigated. We
will focus on the idea of federated analysis. In a federated setting,
the data with the data owner, who keeps full control over it. In this
case, it is not the data that travels, but the analysis itself. The
system sends a query or instruction to the data and only the results
will get back to the user. The results are often akin to a form of
<em>aggregation</em> of the data. This can be in the shape of
traditional statistics like the mean, or it can be more intricate like a
machine learning model.</p>
<p>Aggregating the data does not ensure complete protection of
person-level information, but it certainly makes it less likely that
this will happen.</p>
<p>TODO: Example of data leakage in simple aggregated case</p>
</section><section id="federated-learning"><h2 class="section-heading">Federated learning<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#federated-learning"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>The term federated learning was introduced in 2016 by researchers at
Google <a href="https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1602.05629" class="external-link">(McMahan et
al.)</a> and refers to a “loose federation of participating devices
(which we refer to as clients) which are coordinated by a central
server.” In traditional federated learning, the clients train machine
learning models, and only the updates of the models are sent back to the
central server. The central server combines the updates from all the
individual clients into one final machine learning model.</p>
<p>There are caveats to using this type of data analysis though.
Although the data transmitted from the clients to the server are an
aggregation of the raw data, researchers have found a way to use this
data to reconstruct the original data. This vulnerability is called
<em>gradient</em> leakage.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>There are different solutions to prevent the reconstruction of raw
data. One solution is to make sure that no party other than the data
owner is actually able to see the intermediate data. One branch of
techniques that can be used for this is Secure Multiparty Computation
(MPC). With MPC,<br>
computations are performed collaboratively by multiple parties. Data is
encrypted in such a way that other parties cannot see the original
values, but values of multiple parties can still be combined (
e.g. added or multiplied). A classic technique from the field of MPC is
secret sharing. With this technique data is encrypted, after which
pieces of the encryption are sent to the other parties. No single party
will be able to reconstruct the original value. Only when all parties
work together, the original value can be retrieved.</p>
<p>When combining multiple values using secret sharing, this will result
in the parties owning new puzzle pieces that when put together will
reveal the result of the computation.</p>

<p>As mentioned before, aggregation of data will not always prevent
leaks of sensitive information. Consider the example of Mees, Sara and
Noor. We know their total weight is 127 kg. If Sara and Noor get
together and subtract their weights off of the total, they will be able
to infer how much Mees weighs.</p>
<p>An aggregation is differentially private when someone cannot infer
whether a particular individual was used in the computation. A way to
make a result more differentially private is to replace a selection of
inputs with random noise. A single individual will then always be able
to deny that their data has contributed to the final result. An
individual has <em>plausible deniability</em> with regards to whether it
was part of the dataset.</p>

<p>The previously mentioned techniques are not used in isolation, but
are usually stacked on top of eachother to mitigate the privacy risks
that are relevant within a certain usecase. Typically, the process
begins by anonymizing or pseudonymizing the data. With vantage6, the
data is then placed in a federated setting. You can use the existing
algorithms available for vantage6, which often incorporate various
privacy-enhancing techniques.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>Data sharing challenges come in many different shapes and sizes, but
in the end, the goal of the researchers is often to analyze data <em>as
if</em> it were available in one big table in one place. There are 2
main ways in which the dataset can be separated over different sources:
<strong>horizontal</strong> and <strong>vertical</strong> partioning. In
horizontal partitioning, this giant table has been snipped in pieces by
making horizontal cuts. The result is that information of an individual
record will stay in one place, but the records themselves have been
scattered around in different locations.</p>
<p>In vertical partitioning, the cuts have been made vertically. Columns
have now been divided over different locations. This type of
partitioning is usually more challenging because often a way needs to be
found to link identities across datasources. Vertical partitioning
requires different types of privacy enhancing algorithms than horizontal
partitioning.</p>
<p>In reality, data can be horizontally and vertically partitioned at
the same time. It might be necessary to combine multiple techniques in
order to overcome your problems.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>You have now learned about various technologies for analyzing data
while preserving privacy of individuals. However, it should be
emphasized that these technologies do not solve all your data sharing
problems. Rather, they are only a small piece of the puzzle. In research
projects involving privacy enhancing technologies, a lot of work goes
into complying with regulations and building trust.</p>
<p>Since these projects have a risk of affecting the privacy of
individuals, a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) is usually
required. This is a process that will help identify and minimize privacy
risks of a project and is required by GDPR.</p>
<p>Apart from procedures required by GDPR there might be other
regulations in place enforced by the owners of the data
(e.g. hospitals). The specific situation of a project can affect the way
in which the data is allowed to be processed. Some privacy enhancing
technologies might be allowed in one project but prohibited in another.
It is always important to stay transparent about privacy risks of the
technologies you intend to use.</p>

<p>In vantage6, a <strong>client</strong> can pose a question to the
central <strong>server</strong>. Each organization with sensitive data
contributes one <strong>node</strong> to the network. The nodes collect
the computation request from the server and fetches the
<strong>algorithm</strong> to answer it. When the algorithm completes,
the node sends the aggregated results back to the server.</p>

</figure><p>On a technical level, vantage6 may be seen as a container
orchestration tool for privacy preserving analyses. It deploys a network
of containerized applications that together ensure insights can be
exchanged without sharing record-level data.</p>
<p>Lets explain in some more detail what these network actors are
responsible for, and which subcomponents they contain.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="server">Server<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#server"></a>
</h3>
<p>The A (central) <strong>server</strong> that acts as communication
hub between clients and nodes. The <a href="https://docs.vantage6.ai/en/main/server/index.html" class="external-link">server</a>
tracks the status of the computation requests and handles administrative
functions such as authentication and authorization.It consists of
multiple applications:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Vantage6 server</strong>: Contains the users,
organizations, collaborations, tasks and their results. It handles
authentication and authorization to the system and acts as the
communication hub for clients and nodes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Docker registry</strong>: Contains algorithms stored in
images which can be used by clients to request a computation. The node
will retrieve the algorithm from this registry and execute it. It is
possible to use public registries for this purpose like <a href="https://hub.docker.com/" class="external-link">Docker hub</a> or <a href="https://ghcr.io" class="external-link">Github Containers</a>. However it is also
possible to host your own registry, for example a <a href="https://goharbor.io/" class="external-link">Harbor</a> instance.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Algorithm store</strong>: Is intended to be used as a
repository for trusted algorithms within a certain project. <a href="https://docs.vantage6.ai/en/main/algorithm_store/index.html" class="external-link">Algorithm
stores</a> can be coupled to specific collaborations or to all

<p>The data station hosts the <a href="https://docs.vantage6.ai/en/main/node/index.html" class="external-link">node</a>
(vantage6-node), that have access to the local data and execute

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Vantage6 node</strong>: The node is responsible for
executing the algorithms on the local data. It protects the data by
allowing only specified algorithms to be executed after verifying their
origin. The node is responsible for picking up the task, executing the
algorithm and sending the results back to the server. The node needs
access to local data. For more details see the technical documentation
of the node.</p></li>

<p>A user or application who interacts with the vantage6-server. They
create tasks, retrieve their results, or manage entities at the server
(i.e. creating or editing users, organizations and collaborations).</p>
<p>The vantage6 server is an API, which means that there are many ways
to interact with it programatically. There are however a number of
applications available that make is easier for users to interact with
the vantage6 server:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>User interface</strong> The <a href="https://docs.vantage6.ai/en/main/user/ui.html" class="external-link">user interface</a>
is a web application (hosted at the server) that allows users to
interact with the server. It is used to create and manage organizations,
collaborations, users, tasks and algorithms. It also allows users to
view and download the results of tasks. Use of the user interface
recommended for ease of use.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Python client</strong> The <a href="https://docs.vantage6.ai/en/main/user/pyclient.html" class="external-link">vantage6
python client</a> <python-client> is a Python package that allows users
to interact with the server from a Python environment. This is
especially usefull for data scientists who want to integrate vantage6
into their existing Python workflow.</python-client></p></li>
<li><p><strong>API</strong> It is also possible to interact with the

<h2 id="how-algorithms-run-in-vantage6">How algorithms run in vantage6<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#how-algorithms-run-in-vantage6"></a>
</h2>
<p>Federated algorithms can be split in a <strong>federated</strong> and
a <strong>central</strong> part:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Central</strong>: The central part of the algorithm is
responsible for orchestration and aggregation of the partial
results.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Federated</strong>: The partial tasks are executing
computations on the local privacy sensitive data.</p></li>
</ul>
<figure><img src="fig/algorithm_central_and_subtasks.png" alt="vantage6 central and federated tasks." class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">vantage6 central and federated tasks.</div>
</figure><p>Now, let’s see how this works in vantage6. The user creates a task
for the central part of the algorithm. This is registered at the server,
and leads to the creation of a central algorithm container on one of the
nodes. The central algorithm then creates subtasks for the federated
parts of the algorithm, which again are registered at the server. All
nodes for which the subtask is intended start their work by executing
the federated part of the algorithm. The nodes send the results back to
the server, from where they are picked up by the central algorithm. The
central algorithm then computes the final result and sends it to the
server, where the user can retrieve it</p>

<div class="callout-content">
<p>It is easy to confuse the central server with the central part of the
algorithm: the server is the central part of the infrastructure but not
the place where the central part of the algorithm is executed. The
central part is actually executed at one of the nodes, because it gives
more flexibility: for instance, an algorithm may need heavy compute
resources to do the aggregation, and it is better to do this at a node
that has these resources rather than having to upgrade the server
whenever a new algorithm needs more resources.</p>

<h1 id="future-developments-of-vantage6">Future developments of vantage6<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#future-developments-of-vantage6"></a>
</h1>
<p>Back in 2018 when the development of vantage6 started, the focus was
on Federated Learning. Since then, vantage6 has been extended to support
different types of data sources, different types of algorithms and
improved its usability. Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PET) are a
rapidly evolving field. To keep up with the latest developments, the
vantage6 platform is designed to be flexible and to adapt to new
developments in the field.</p>
<p>From the development team we are working towards making vantage6 the
PETOps platform for all your (distributed) analysis needs.</p>
<p>[Image of the PETOps cycle]</p>
<p>We identified a number of areas where we want to improve and extend
vantage6 in order to achieve this goal:</p>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="policies">Policies<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#policies"></a>
</h2>
<p>Currently, vantage6 lets you set several policies, such as the
organizations that are allowed to participate in a collaboration, the
algorithms that are allowed to run on the nodes, and the data that is
allowed to be used in a collaboration. We want to extend this to a more
generic policy framework in which any aspect of the vantage6 platform
can be controlled by policies. This will maximize the flexibility of the
platform and make it easier to adapt to new use cases.</p>
<p>For example, it would be possible:</p>
<ul>
<li>Define the version of vantage6 that is allowed to be used in a
collaboration</li>
<li>Which users is allowed to run a certain algorithm</li>
<li>Which algorithms are allowed in a collaboration/study</li>
<li>Define privacy guards at algorithm level</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to avoid that policies need to be set manually at the nodes,
we envision a distributed policy system (possibly using Blocakchain) in
which policies are distributed to the nodes by the server.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="model-repository">Model Repository<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#model-repository"></a>
</h2>
<p>Currently vantage6 is focused on privacy enhancing techniques. Some
of these techniques result in a model that can be used to make
predictions. We want to extend vantage6 with a model repository in which
these models can be stored, shared and used. This will make it easier to
reuse models and to compare the performance of different models.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="build-services">Build Services<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#build-services"></a>
</h2>
<p>Algorithms in vantage6 are shipped as container images. Currently,
this image can be build by the user or some external process. We want to
extend vantage6 with a build service that can build the container image
for you. This will make it easier to develop and deploy algorithms in
vantage6 but more importantly, it will enhance the security of the
platform as they are build in a controlled environment.</p>

<p>To navigate vantage6’s UI seamlessly, it’s essential to grasp the
platform’s fundamental concepts and their interconnections, as the UI
design reflects these relationships. The following is a simplified model
of vantage6 concepts, where a <code>1-n</code> relationship means that
the entity on the left side of the relationship is related to one or
more entities on the right side. For instance, a
<strong>collaboration</strong> involves one or more
<strong>nodes</strong>, but each <strong>node</strong> can only be
linked to exactly one <strong>collaboration</strong>. An
<code>n-n</code> relationship is a many-to-many relationship: for
instance, a <strong>collaboration</strong> can involve multiple
<strong>organizations</strong>, and at the same time, each
<strong>organization</strong> can participate in multiple
<strong>collaborations</strong>.</p>

<ul>
<li>An organization has zero or more <strong>users</strong> who can

<li>An organization can have multiple <strong>nodes</strong>, one for

</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Collaboration</strong>: a collection of one or more
<strong>organizations</strong> working together towards a shared
objective.</p>
<ul>
<li>In a specific <strong>collaboration</strong>, each participating
<strong>organization</strong> needs one <strong>node</strong> to compute
<strong>tasks</strong>; In another <strong>collaboration</strong>, the
same <strong>organization</strong> must have a separate
<strong>node</strong> for this <strong>collaboration</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Node</strong>: the component with access to the
organization data, which also executes algorithms on it. It represents

collaborations<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#from-theory-to-practice-a-hypothetical-case-study-using-vantage6-collaborations"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>As previously discussed, in vantage6 a collaboration refers to an
agreement between two or more parties to participate in a study or to
answer a research question together. This concept is central to the
Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs) that vantage6 supports. Each party
involved in a collaboration remains autonomous, meaning they retain
control over their data and can decide how much of their data to
contribute to the collaboration’s global model and which algorithms are
allowed for execution.</p>
<p>To illustrate this, let’s analyze a hypothetical scenario: two
international research projects relying on vantage6 technology on the
same server:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first one, <strong>PhY2024</strong> (Prevalence of hypertension
and its association with lifestyle), requires determining the average
systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels of the population across
France, Spain, and The Netherlands.</li>
<li>The second, <strong>GHT</strong> (Global Health Trends), requires
determining the Average BMI across The Netherlands, Spain, and
Germany.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although both projects are unrelated and independent from each other,
the data from Spain and The Netherlands -required by both- is provided
by the same large-scale cohort studies, namely CANTABRIA (Spain) and
LIFELINES (The Netherlands). However, legal agreements dictate that each
project is granted access solely to the data essential for its intended
purposes (gaining access to the whole set of variables study increases
risks of inference attacks). Data from the French and German population
(for <strong>PhY2024</strong> and <strong>GHT</strong> studies), on the
other hand, will be provided by the GAZEL and GNC prospective cohort
studies.</p>
<p>Following vantage6’s concepts, this scenario would involve two
collaborations, one for each research project. As described in previous
episodes, a vantage6 node is needed for each collaboration.
Consequently, as illustrated in the diagram below, both CANTABRIA and
LIFELINES organizations require two vantage6 data-node instances each.
Since each data node defines its own rules for data access and algorithm
usage, this ensures that analyses from various collaborations, even
those involving shared organizations/datasets, will not conflict with
one another.</p>

</h3>
<p>While a vantage6-supported research infrastructure like the one
described above offers a strong defense against many data privacy risks,
there remains one crucial security aspect that falls outside the
platform’s scope: the validation of the code that will run on this
infrastructure. For instance, the administrators of the nodes running
within each organization are responsible for defining which algorithms
(i.e., <a href="https://docs.vantage6.ai/en/main/node/configure.html#all-configuration-options" class="external-link">which
container images</a>) will be allowed for execution on the respective
collaborations. As this is a critical and complex task that entails
activities like code analysis and verification, working with algorithms
from trusted sources is the primary line of defense against potential
threats.</p>
<p>Vantage6’s algorithm store feature aims to enhance trustworthiness by
offering a centralized platform for managing pre-registered algorithms.
This serves as an alternative to using algorithms from unknown authors
or those lacking transparency regarding their development process and
status. The algorithm store currently allows researchers to explore
which algorithms are available and how to run them. This, along with its
integration with vantage6’s UI, streamlines task execution requests
within collaborations.</p>
<p>As of the time of writing this tutorial, efforts are underway to
integrate additional information to the algorithm metadata such as
creators and code reviewers. Moreover, plans are in place to incorporate
the algorithm review process into the publication procedure for any
algorithms in the store.</p>

<p>First, let’s take a look at one of the federated algorithms

episode: <a href="https://github.com/IKNL/v6-average-py/blob/master/v6-average-py/__init__.py" class="external-link">a
federated average</a>.</p>
<p>Analyze the algorithm based on the code and its comments and answer
the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How are the <code>central_average</code> and
<code>partial_average</code> functions related?</li>
<li>Why does the <code>central_average</code> function, unlike
<code>partial_average</code>, doesn’t get any data as an input?</li>
<li>Analyze and discuss the potential outcomes if a Task to execute
<code>central_average</code> is initiated within a collaboration where
one of the nodes is offline.</li>
