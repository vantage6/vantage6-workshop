## Target Audience
### Newbies
Want to run basic federated data analyses
#### Prerequisites
- Know how to do data analysis in a centralized setting

### Data scientist
Knows what the newbie knows. Want more control over their analyses. Potentially develop their own
federated algorithms.

#### Prerequisites
- Basic (!) python knowledge
- Experience with command line
- Knows how to do federated analysis using the vantage6 UI

### Sys admin (not targeted)
People who install vantage6. We are probably not going to cover this topic.

#### Prerequisites
- Lots of prerequisites

## Objectives (we need max. 8)
### Newbie objectives
1. Understand the basic concepts of PET
   - Understand PET, FL, MPC, homomorphic encryption, differential privacy
   - Understand how different PET techniques relate
   - Understand scenarios where PET could be applied
   - Understand horizontal vs vertical partitioning
   - Decompose a simple analysis in a federated way 
   - Understand that there is paperwork to be done (DPIA etc.)
2. Understanding v6
   - List the high-level infrastructure components of v6 (server, client, node)
   - Understand that there is different actors in algorithms
   - Understand that the v6 server does not run algorithms
   - Explain how a simple analysis runs on v6
   - Understand the problems that v6 solves
   - Understand how to apply v6 to FL scenarios
   - Understand the future of vantage6
   - Be able to manage v6 collaborations with the UI
3. Running PET analysis without programming
   - Know some analyses that are available

### Data scientist objectives
1. Make your data available to a v6 network
2. Run PET analysis using the python client
3. Creating basic algorithms
4. (Optional) Creating advanced algorithms using other libraries?

### Rejected objectives
- setting up v6 infrastructure (very difficult, requires different prerequisites)
- how to do the paperwork
