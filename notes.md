## Target Audience
### Newbies
Want to run basic federated data analyses
#### Prerequisites
- Know how to do data analysis in a centralized setting

### Data scientist
Knows what the newbie knows. Want more control over their analyses. Potentially develop their own
federated algorithms.

#### Prerequisites
- Basic (!) python knowledge
- Experience with command line
- Knows how to do federated analysis using the vantage6 UI

### Sys admin (not targeted)
People who install vantage6. We are probably not going to cover this topic.

#### Prerequisites
- Lots of prerequisites

## Objectives (we need max. 8)
### Newbie objectives
1. Understanding privacy enhancing technology (PET) and federated learning
  - Understand scenarios where PET could be applied
  - Understand that there is paperwork to be done (DPIA etc.)
2. Understanding v6
  - Understand how to apply v6 to FL scenarios
  - Understand the future of vantage6
  - Understand how to manage v6 collaborations
3. Running PET analysis without programming
   - Know some analyses that are available

### Data scientist objectives
1. Make your data available to a v6 network
2. Run PET analysis using the python client
3. Creating basic algorithms
4. (Optional) Creating advanced algorithms using other libraries?

### Rejected objectives
- setting up v6 infrastructure (very difficult, requires different prerequisites)
- how to do the paperwork
